As part of my pizza sales analysis project, I created a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to better understand the restaurant’s sales performance. 
The goal of these KPIs is to provide an overview of overall revenue, order patterns, and customer purchasing behavior. 
Each metric serves as a foundation for deeper analysis — for example, identifying peak sales periods, evaluating promotions, or assessing profitability.
Below is a description of the KPIs I calculated, their purpose, and their business relevance:

1. Total Revenue
This KPI represents the total income generated from all sales during a specific period. It provides a high-level view of business performance and allows the identification of trends, 
such as seasonal variations or the impact of promotions.

Why I calculated it:
To evaluate how much revenue the pizzeria generates over time and to help determine whether new product launches or marketing campaigns have a positive financial effect.

    SELECT
	    SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue
    FROM
    	pizza_sales

2. AOV – Average Order Value
Average Order Value shows how much customers spend on average per order.

Business impact:
A higher AOV may indicate successful upselling (e.g., adding drinks or sides), while a lower AOV might suggest a need for bundle offers, loyalty programs, or minimum delivery thresholds.

    SELECT
	    sum(total_price) / count(DISTINCT order_id) AS AOV
    FROM
	      pizza_sales
