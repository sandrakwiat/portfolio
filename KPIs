As part of my pizza sales analysis project, I created a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to better understand the restaurant’s sales performance. 
The goal of these KPIs is to provide an overview of overall revenue, order patterns, and customer purchasing behavior. 
Each metric serves as a foundation for deeper analysis — for example, identifying peak sales periods, evaluating promotions, or assessing profitability.
Below is a description of the KPIs I calculated, their purpose, and their business relevance:

1.  Total Revenue
This KPI represents the total income generated from all sales during a specific period. It provides a high-level view of business performance and allows the identification of trends, 
such as seasonal variations or the impact of promotions.
I calucalted it to evaluate how much revenue the pizzeria generates over time and to help determine whether new product launches or marketing campaigns have a positive financial effect.

  					  SELECT
	  					  SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue
  					  FROM
    					pizza_sales

2.  AOV – Average Order Value
Average Order Value shows how much customers spend on average per order.
A higher AOV may indicate successful upselling (e.g., adding drinks or sides), while a lower AOV might suggest a need for bundle offers, loyalty programs, or minimum delivery thresholds.

  				  SELECT
				    sum(total_price) / count(DISTINCT order_id) AS AOV
   				 FROM
	      			pizza_sales
			
3. Total Pizzas Sold

	This KPI measures the total number of pizzas sold within the selected period.
	It helps assess product demand and plan inventory accordingly. Tracking this metric over time can also highlight top-selling items and guide menu optimization.

					SELECT 	
						sum(quantity) 	
					FROM  
						pizza_sales

4. Total Orders
	This metric counts the total number of completed orders, regardless of their value.	
	It gives insight into overall customer activity and can reveal sales patterns across days, weeks, or months. 
	It’s also a useful measure when analyzing marketing effectiveness — an increase in orders often reflects successful campaigns or special offers.


				SELECT
					count(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders_count
				FROM
					pizza_sales ps

5. Average Pizzas per Order
	This KPI indicates how many pizzas on average are purchased per order.
	It helps understand customer behavior — whether most orders are made by individuals or groups. 
	This can inform strategic decisions, such as offering discounts on multiple pizzas or creating family-size deals.

				SELECT
					sum(quantity)/ count(DISTINCT order_id) AS average_pizza_per_order
				FROM
					pizza_sales ps
